# ToVisitExtension
A chrome extension created to save links of the websites which we wish to revisit later for some reasons.

I / We offen create shortcuts of some important websited from Google Chrome to our Desktop so that we can later re-visit the website.

Seeing this in my ming i have used HTML, CSS and JavaScript to make an extension which helps us to save these websited in it for our later use.
